# Crypto Commons

_Crypto Commons is the Gordian reference code & CLI utilities. It collects together all of Blockchain Commons' wallet libraries and the utilities built from them._

## Additional Information

The Crypto Commons includes reference libraries (mostly in C), which can be used to build wallets; and demos & tools, which exercise and exemplify those wallet libraries.

### Gordian Tools & Demos

_Blockchain Commons has released a number of kits and CLI tools that exercise the Gordian reference libraries._

* **[Keytool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli) \(CLI\).** A tool for deriving keys and addresses from seeds. 
  * _Uses [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base)._
* **[LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) \(Hardware Kit\).** A do-it-yourself hardware kit for generating and translating seeds in an airgapped manner. Cotains its own version of seedtool built using the Arduino IDE.
  * _LetheKit's Seedtool exercises [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base), [bc-bip-39](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-bip39), [bc-bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [bc-sskr](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) (the last through a bc-ur-arduino port)._
* **[Seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) \(CLI\).** A tool for generating seeds from a variety of random inputs and for translating seeds among formats like BIP39, [SSKR](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr), hex, and [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md).
   * _Exercises [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base), [bc-bip-39](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-bip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [bc-sskr](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur)._
* **[URDemo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URDemo) \(Demo\).** A demonstration of the [URKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit) that can be compiled and run in Xcode using Swift. It demonstrates multi-part animated QRs.

### Gordian Reference Libraries

_The Crypto Commons libraries are reference implementations, meant to be examples of how to standardly implement these various crypto functions._

* **[bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir) \(C\).** Implementation of Shamir Secret Sharing.
* **[bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39) \(C\).** Implementation of Satoshi Labs' [SLIP-39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md). 
  * _Largely deprected due to discovery of round-trip failure with BIP-39. Blockchain Commons projects use [bc-sskr](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr) instead._
 * **[bc-sskr](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr) \(C\).** Implementation of Sharmir Secret Sharing Key Recovery, an alternative to SLIP-39 that allows round-tripping with BIP-39, as described in [BCR-2020-011](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md).
   * _The SSKR methodology is an alternative to SLIP-39 that converts Shamir shards to [URs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) or [bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md). Its main improvement over SLIP-39 is that it  round trips with BIP-39, whereas [SLIP-39 does not](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/issues/38)._
* **[bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) \(C++\).** Implementation of Blockchain Commons' UR standard for Uniform Resources, as described in [BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).  
   * _The UR methodology allows the encoding of binary data of arbitrary content and length and their transportation using one or more URIs or QR codes (or alternatively animated QR codes). It also integrates with [bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md)._
   * _Blockchain Commons' UR has also been widely implemented in other languages:_
      * **[bc-ur-java](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-java) \(Java\).** A Java implementation created by Bitmark.
      * **[URKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit) (Swift).** A Swift implementation that encodes and decodes URs.
      * Third-party implementations of UR include **[Hummingbird](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/hummingbird) (Java)**, **[foundation-ur-py](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py) (Python)**, and **[ur-rs](https://github.com/dspicher/ur-rs) (Rust)**.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
