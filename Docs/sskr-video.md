# SSKR Video Example

The following video shows the recovery of a [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) with SSKR shares, using first an example with a threshold of two, then an example with a threshold of three. It goes by very quickly!

In the video, the user scans QR codes for the SSKRs, rebuilds the account within Gordian Wallet, then looks at addresses to ensure the wallet is correct.
