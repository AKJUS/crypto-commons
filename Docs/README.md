# Documents

Blockchain Commons has produced a variety of documentation of interest to developers and users of blockchains.

## The Crypto Commons

Our crypto-commons specifications, reference tools, and libraries offer new interoperable methodologies for cryptocurrency wallets, and may be of interest to developers and users.

### Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)

SSKRs allow a seed to be sharded into shares that can be stored as words, URs, or QRs.

1. [SSKR for Users](sskr-users.md)
   * [SSKR Cold Storage](sskr-cold-storage.md)
   * [SSKR Video Example](sskr-video.md)
1. [SSKR for Developers](sskr-developers.md)
   * [SSKR Test Vector](sskr-test-vector.md)

### Uniform Resources (URs)

URs allow for the interoperable transmission and storage of a variety of information, especially cryptographic data.

1. [URs: An Overview](ur-1-overview.md)
   * [A Guide to Using URs for Key Material](ur-2-keys.md)
   * [A Guide to Using URs for SSKRs](ur-3-sskrs.md)
1. [A Guide to Using UR Request & Response](ur-99-request-response.md)

### Coming Soon

_We are planning one more UR article in the near future, detailing how to use URs with PSBTs._

_Please feel free to file an issue if there's more Crypto Commons specifications that you'd like to see with more extensive documents._
